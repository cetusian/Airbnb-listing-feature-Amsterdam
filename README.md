# Airbnb-listing-feature-Amsterdam
A feature for Airbnb that shows the best listings for you based on the locations you are planning to visit in Amsterdam. Wouldn't it make sense to choose a place to stay in a location closest to where you're likely to go most often?

The app will show you the listings that are less than 500 RON/night. (RON is my country's currency)

## Built on Streamlit
Try the feature using Streamlit: https://madalintat-airbnb-listing-feature-amsterda-streamlit-app-e5nbsv.streamlit.app/

### Upimit Course Project
This project was created as part of my participation in Python for Data Science by Samir Sen on Uplimit (ex-CoRise).
